    <p>I love the Allegro 2 reformer however the springs aren't my personal favorite as the tension isn't 
    distinguisible between the blue and red spring. Aesthetically though it is the prettiest reformer in my opinion. 4/5 stars </p>

    <p>The Studio Reformer is the reformer that I use the most for my teaching as well as the classes I take myself. I find this
    reformer super user friendly and there are so many things you can do on the reformer itself. 5/5 stars</p>

    <p>The Allegro Reformer is my least favorite reformer from Balanced Body. It's not as versatile
    and there are a lot less exercises to do on this reformer. While it is much more compact, there isn't much that you can do on it. 2/5 stars</p>

    <img src="images/Reformer%20Trapeze.jpg" alt="NY Pilates" style="width:100%">
  <p>The Reformer Trapeze Combination is the best reformer for those who want to be able to do the most exercises and
  have plenty of options to modify exercises. This is the most versatile reformer since it is also a cadillac- the downside? How big it is and how
  much space it takes up. 4/5 stars </p>
