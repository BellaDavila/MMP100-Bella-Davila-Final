        <h2>Natural Pilates</h2>
       <div class="img-container">
           <img src="Images/trial.jpg" alt="Natural Pilates" class="image">
       </div>
<p>Natural Pilates is a wonderful studio - but I would only recommend this studio for those who 
        have Reformer Pilates experience and are comfortable on the machine. It's a fast-paced class and 
        you should definitely be comfortable with cueing and Pilates terminology. I really enjoy all the different
        classes they have and I definitely feel the burn in every class.</p>

        <h2>Fuze House </h2>
        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="Images/Fuze%20House.jpg" class="image">
        </div>
        <p>Fuze House is specifically a mat hot Pilates studio- the heat definitely adds an ectra 
        spicy element that I love. I love the incorporation of props (like weights, and bands) to give an extra burn
        and I always leave sweaty and glowing. </p>

        <h2>NY Pilates</h2>
        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="Images/NY%20Pilates.jpg" class="image">
        </div>
        <p>NY Pilates is definitely the most aesthetically pleasing studio out of all these options, and is pretty 
        beginner friendly. While I love the studio (and it always smells good) because I have been doing Pilates for
        so long I don't feel the classes are as challenging as other studios but it is always great for a quick little workout to move the body.</p>

        <h2>Club Pilates</h2>
        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="Images/CP%20Photo.jpg" class="image">
        </div>
        <p>I am currently an instructor for Club Pilates specifically and I absolutely love this studio (maybe I'm a 
        little biased). Club Pilates is extremely injury friendly and pregnancy friendly, and truly for everybody and person.
        Depending on which class you take you can get a really good difficult workout- but there also slower paced classes
        if that's not your jam. Highly recommend you come and try us out! </p>
